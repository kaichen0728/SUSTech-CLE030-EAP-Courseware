**EAP(CLE030)** is a must-learn English course @SUSTech. 'EAP' stands for 'English for academic purposes', which focuses on academic presenting and writing.

The course itself is not that hard, while the key is to formalize your expression and to know rules to obey in academic things.

I took the course in Spring 2025, and this repository listed the courseware I used.

The course is a bit boring, so I tried to make it fun and more valuable for myself. I tried to use beamer for the first time of my life to make our group's introductive presentation look more professional, which is marks the highlight of this course.

Remark: The whole reposity is protected in MIT lisence.
